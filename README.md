# Machine Learning With Javascript
mainly focussed on LINEAR REGRESSION and CLASSIFICATION algorithm chosen.

## FEATURE(variable) analysis with K value using KNN(K nearest neighbour alorithm for our HTML page game- like PLINK game show )

keepping all other FEATURES as is, K =10, 11, 12 gave about 20 to 30 percent prediction .

Then narrowing the testing with value of K=10, 11 AND 12, .. with k=10 gave the best result in the console 
feature value 0 meaning BALL POSITION 
feature value 1 meaning BALL BOUNCINESS 
feature value 2 meaning BALL SIZE

BUCKET NUMBER not being FEATURE but rather the LABEL , TO BE PREDICTED as per variations in the FEATURES mentioned above.

for feature value of  0 your accuracy is :  0.32
score.js:28 for feature value of  1 your accuracy is :  0.2
score.js:28 for feature value of  2 your accuracy is :  0.28
